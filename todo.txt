new map: winter event town/patrian/ipcus/forsaken hollow. mobs are random players. light tint for weaker mobs. red tint for strong
other map; one of maloha temple maps? More AP. mobs are just players from the map

blue 400k FL
puffs 677k
MP 580k

290, 291, 292, 293, 313, 319, 
101 - 336


I also wanna make the Crystal Critters spawn randomly over every map we have. I want like 2-3 to randomly spawn per map, every 30 minutes. 

They’re gonna be weak weak, so no need for additional scripts to be added. It’ll be a basic NPC but they’ll drop the Energy Crystals for the Slot Machines.
The NPC is 480, I've already set the respawn timer for 30 minutes.


I’ll be creating the Million Dollar Man here soon.
When he spawns the server will say, “Look it’s that damn rich guy again...”. My POINT is, he will give 1M EXP, and have a 10% chance to drop his wallet of 1M GP.
He will spawn once every 24 hours randomly somewhere in the world. He’ll hit for 1M and have 1M HP. But he’ll be an extra way to earn EXP.

RESTORE DATABASE IllutiaGoose_2018_09_14 FROM DISK='C:\shared\IllutiaGoose.bak'
WITH REPLACE, RECOVERY, 
   MOVE 'IllutiaGoose' TO 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL14.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA\IllutiaGoose_2018_09_14.mdf',
   MOVE 'IllutiaGoose_log' TO 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL14.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\DATA\IllutiaGoose_2018_09_14_log.ldf'
   


or fix quests to not rely on id?


Packet refactoring still to do:
* CustomCommandEvent
* Scripts
something broken with pet NextRespawnTime? what is setting it.
Bank is going to be different between Asp and Illutia.
Aspereta doesn't have spellbook pages
